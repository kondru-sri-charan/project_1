Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Java & Web)

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with two different interfaces: a command-line version in pure Java and an interactive web version using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project showcases the implementation of the same game logic across different technology stacks, serving as a great example of core programming principles applied to both backend and frontend development.
